# Snapclone

Snapclone is a snapchat clone written in React Native (Expo) & Typescript.
It uses redux and redux-thunk for state managment.

## How it works

You can take an image or a video. Then you can send it to any of your contacts. Since there
is no backend you will receive it from the contact you send it to. This simulates the arrival of a new
snap.

## Test QR

You can scan this QR to add an example contact.
